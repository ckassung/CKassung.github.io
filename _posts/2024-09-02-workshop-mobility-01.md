## Material Cultures of Mobility

This exploratory workshop aims to foster research into the historical interplay
between mobility, cultural techniques, and material culture. By examining how
cultural techniques, technologies, and objects have historically facilitated
movement and shaped travel, we seek to develop new research questions that can
lead to future grant applications. Through interdisciplinary collaboration,
participants will explore themes such as the evolution of travel technologies,
the socio-economic impacts and material manifestations of mobility.
