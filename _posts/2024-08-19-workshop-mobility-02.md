## Cultural Techniques and Material Cultures at Sea

This exploratory workshop aims to foster research into the historical interplay
between mobility, cultural techniques, and material culture within maritime and
coastal contexts. By examining how cultures, cultural techniques, and nature
have historically shaped life, work, and travel at sea, we seek to develop new
research questions that can lead to future grant applications. Through
interdisciplinary collaboration, participants will explore themes such as the
maritime technologies, littoral knowledge production, and the material
manifestations of aquatic and coastal communities. Special attention will be
given to the concept of »Störungen« (disruptions) and their influence on
practices and objects, like environmental challenges, to border regimes and
shipping accidents. This workshop will provide a platform for investigating the
dynamic interactions between human practices and maritime environments,
emphasizing the unique cultural techniques, material cultures that emerge in
littoral and marine settings.
